# Embedded Systems Project: Weather Station (CS122A)

This project displays the time, temperature, altitude, and messages in the LCD screen. 
I use a altimeter sensor (BMP085) to retrieve the temperature and altitude. 
The time is inputted when the system starts and updates itself from then.
The user may type in messages by using the keypad.
